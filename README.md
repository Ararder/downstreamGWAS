downstreamGWAS is a companion package to [tidyGWAS](www.arvidharder.com/tidyGWAS).
downstreamGWAS provides functions to run standardize genetic pipelines using
summary statistics as input. External software is packaged through docker files available at 
[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arvhar/genetics/general).

In addition to this, reference files needed for pipelines bundled into the containers are available through zenodo. Link TBD. 

DownstreamGWAS utilises three factors to make genetic analysis much simplified:
1.  Harmonized GWAS format through [tidyGWAS](www.arvidharder.com/tidyGWAS)
2.  External software packaged into docker images, that can be run on HPCs with singularity/apptainer
3.  References files collected and available for download, with harmonized filepaths


## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("ararder/downstreamGWAS")
devtools::install_github("ararder/downstreamGWAS")
```
downstreamGWAS requires a filepaths.yml file to be created, and for you to add
some information to it.


```{r}
dir_to_store_yaml_in = "/nas/depts/007/sullilab/shared/gwas_sumstats"
setup_filepaths_yml(dir_to_store_yaml_in)
# get script to download singularity images
sif_script()

```
